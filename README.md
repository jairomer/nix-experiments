# Nix experiments

This repository is a collection of tests for using the Nix packet manager to assure the replicability at the operating system level.

## Motivation

I am sick of repeating myself and wasting time when doing systems administration work.

You cannot do everything with Dockerfiles, sometimes you need to build, install and configure drivers, utilities, and development environments.
